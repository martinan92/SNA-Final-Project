# SNA-Final-Project

This project focused on a network analysis of current masters students at IE. The connections of interest included programs, home regions as well as interests with regards to 3 key categories (movies, music, and sports). The purpose of this analysis is to discover otherwise unseen connections between various students as well as to determine the students who demonstrate the greatest measures of centrality with the rest of the network.
